# Task_7

## Conditional Statements (if, elif, else) in Python

### Objective:
Control program flow based on conditions using if, elif, and else.

### Example:
python
if condition:
    # Execute this block if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Execute if previous condition was False, but this one is True
else:
    # Execute if all above conditions are False


### Best Practices:
- Keep conditions clear and structured.
- Use elif instead of multiple if statements to improve efficiency.
- Use f-strings for clean outputÂ formatting.
