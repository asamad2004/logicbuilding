    "      > Variables & Basic Data Types (Numbers & Strings)\n",
    "        Objective: Understanding what variables are and how integer, float, and string data types work in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "      > 1. What are Variables?\n",
    "        A variable in Python is like a container that holds data. You can assign a value to a variable, and the variable will store that value. \n",
    "        The value can be anything: a number, a string, or more complex data.\n",
    "        Syntax: variable_name = value\n",
    "                            x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "      > 2. Data Types in Python\n",
    "        Python has several data types, but we will focus on three basic types: Integer, Float, and String.\n",
    "        a) Integer (int)\n",
    "\n",
    "        An integer is a whole number without a decimal point.\n",
    "        Example: age = 25  # integer\n",
    "\n",
    "        b) Float (float)\n",
    "        A float is a number that has a decimal point.\n",
    "        Example: height = 5.9  # float\n",
    "\n",
    "        c) String (str)\n",
    "        A string is a sequence of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes.\n",
    "        Example: name = \"John Doe\"  # string\n",
    "                 greeting = 'Hello!'  # string\n",
    "\n",
    "       > 3. Best Practices\n",
    "        Descriptive Names: Use meaningful names for variables. For example, instead of x or a, use age, height,\n",
    "        or student_name so that the variable’s purpose is clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Consistency: Stick to one naming convention throughout the program.\n",
    "        Typically, variables are written in lowercase letters and separated by underscores (snake_case), like student_age or course_name.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Avoid Overwriting Built-in Names: Don’t name your variables after built-in Python functions or keywords like list, print, input, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Example Code:- \n",
    "        # Integer Variable\n",
    "        age = 21\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Float Variable\n",
    "        height = 5.8\n",
    "\n",
    "        # String Variable\n",
    "        name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Printing variables\n",
    "        print(f\"{name} is {age} years old and {height} feet tall.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Task_4\n",
    "      > Detailed Exploration of Strings\n",
    "        Objective: Understanding string manipulation, concatenation, slicing, and formatting using f-strings or .format() in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. String Manipulation\n",
    "           Strings in Python are incredibly versatile. You can manipulate them in many ways, \n",
    "           such as changing their case, splitting them into parts, and formatting them for output.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. String Methods\n",
    "           Python provides several built-in methods that you can use on strings to manipulate and work with them:\n",
    "\n",
    "          .upper(): Converts all characters in a string to uppercase.\n",
    "          .lower(): Converts all characters in a string to lowercase.\n",
    "          .split(): Splits a string into a list, based on a delimiter (e.g., space, comma, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. Practice Example:\n",
    "           # User input capturing education problems\n",
    "            education_problems = input(\"Enter your thoughts on the problems with education: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "           # Convert the string to uppercase\n",
    "            uppercase_problems = education_problems.upper()\n",
    "            print(f\"Uppercase Version: {uppercase_problems}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "           # Convert the string to lowercase\n",
    "            lowercase_problems = education_problems.lower()\n",
    "            print(f\"Lowercase Version: {lowercase_problems}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "           # Split the string into words (by spaces) and display the list\n",
    "            splitted_problems = education_problems.split()\n",
    "            print(f\"Split Version (Words): {splitted_problems}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "           # Format the string with f-string\n",
    "            formatted_string = f\"Education Problems: {education_problems}\"\n",
    "            print(formatted_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "          4. Best Practices:\n",
    "             String Concatenation: For combining strings, f-strings are recommended for readability and performance.\n",
    "             Case conversion: Use .upper() or .lower() when you need to normalize the case for comparison or display.\n",
    "             Splitting strings: Use .split() when you want to break up a string into individual components, \n",
    "             especially when working with structured data or text.\n",
    "Task_5\n",
    "      > Other Data Types: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries\n",
    "        Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Lists: Ordered, mutable collection.\n",
    "        Tuples: Ordered, immutable collection.\n",
    "        Dictionaries: Key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Lists (Ordered, Mutable Collection)\n",
    "           A list is an ordered collection of items, and it is mutable, meaning you can change its content after creation.\n",
    "           Lists are defined using square brackets ([]), and items are separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "           Example of a list:  learning_topics = [\"Variables\", \"Data Types\", \"Control Flow\", \"Functions\", \"Loops\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. Tuples (Ordered, Immutable Collection)\n",
    "           A tuple is similar to a list, but unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot modify the items once the tuple is created.\n",
    "           Tuples are defined using parentheses (()).\n",
    "\n",
    "           Example of a tuple:  project_elements = (\"feedback\", \"progress\", \"status\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. Dictionaries (Key-Value Pairs)\n",
    "           A dictionary is an unordered collection of items, where each item is stored as a pair consisting of a key and a value.\n",
    "           Dictionaries are defined using curly braces ({}), and the key-value pairs are separated by a colon (:).\n",
    "\n",
    "           Example of a dictionary:  project_status = {\"topic\": \"Variables\", \"status\": \"Not Started\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. Practice:\n",
    "           A list of learning topics.\n",
    "           A tuple that holds elements of a mini-project.\n",
    "           A dictionary to represent the status of a mini-project element.\n",
    "\n",
    "        5. Best Practices:\n",
    "           Lists: Use lists when you need to store an ordered collection of items that you might need to modify (add/remove elements).\n",
    "           Tuples: Use tuples when you need an ordered collection of items that should remain constant (e.g., coordinates, fixed data).\n",
    "           Dictionaries: Use dictionaries for storing key-value pairs, \n",
    "           especially when you need to map a specific piece of data (like the status of a task or project).\n",
    "\n",
    "Task_6\n",
    "      > Operators: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical\n",
    "\n",
    "        Objective:\n",
    "        Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. In this task, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Understand different types of operators.\n",
    "        Use arithmetic operators for calculations.\n",
    "        Use comparison and logical operators to check conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "           Used for mathematical operations:\n",
    "            Example:\n",
    "            a = 10\n",
    "            b = 3\n",
    "            print(a + b)  # Addition → 13\n",
    "            print(a - b)  # Subtraction → 7\n",
    "            print(a * b)  # Multiplication → 30\n",
    "            print(a / b)  # Division → 3.33\n",
    "            print(a // b) # Floor Division → 3\n",
    "            print(a % b)  # Modulus (Remainder) → 1\n",
    "            print(a ** b) # Exponentiation → 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. Assignment Operators\n",
    "           Used to assign values:\n",
    "            Example:\n",
    "            x = 10\n",
    "            x += 5  # x = x + 5 → 15\n",
    "            x *= 2  # x = x * 2 → 30\n",
    "            print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. Comparison Operators\n",
    "           Used for value comparison (returns True/False):\n",
    "            Example:\n",
    "            a, b = 10, 3\n",
    "            print(a > b)   # True\n",
    "            print(a < b)   # False\n",
    "            print(a == b)  # False\n",
    "            print(a != b)  # True\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. Logical Operators\n",
    "           Used for multiple conditions:\n",
    "            Example:\n",
    "            score = 75\n",
    "            attendance = 85\n",
    "            \n",
    "            if score > 50 and attendance > 75:\n",
    "                print(\"Pass with good attendance\")  # Output: Pass with good attendance\n",
    "\n",
    "        5 Best Practices\n",
    "            Use f-strings for clean formatting in print statements.\n",
    "            Use comparison and logical operators for making decisions in programs.\n",
    "            Use proper indentation for if-else conditions to avoid errors."
