# Task_8

## For Loop in Python

### Objective:
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string, dictionary, etc.).

### Example:
```python
for variable in sequence:
    for topic in learning_topics:
        # Code to execute in loop
```
## Best Practices:

- Use `enumerate()` if you need index values.
- Use `.items()` for iterating key-value pairs in dictionaries.
- Avoid modifying lists while looping to prevent errors.
