## You Need to Know About Comments:

### 1. Single-line Comment
A single-line comment starts with a `#` symbol. Everything after the `#` on that line is considered a comment.

**Example:**
```python
# This is a single-line comment
x = 10  # This is an inline comment
```

### 2. Multi-line Comment
Python doesnâ€™t have a specific syntax for multi-line comments, but you can use multiple single-line comments or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) to create multi-line comments.

**Example:**
```python
"""This is a multi-line comment.
It can span several lines and can be used
for detailed explanations."""
x = 10
```

## You Need to Know About Indentation:

Indentation in Python refers to the spaces or tabs used at the beginning of a line of code to define the structure and hierarchy of the code.

### Why Indentation is Important in Python:
- **Defines code blocks:** It helps Python understand which statements belong together, such as inside a function or a loop.
- **Improves readability:** Proper indentation makes your code more readable and structured.
