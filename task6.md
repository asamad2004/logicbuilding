# Task_6: Operators - Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical

## Objective:
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. In this task, we will:

- Understand different types of operators.
- Use arithmetic operators for calculations.
- Use comparison and logical operators to check conditions.

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical operations:

#### Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Addition → 13
print(a - b)  # Subtraction → 7
print(a * b)  # Multiplication → 30
print(a / b)  # Division → 3.33
print(a // b) # Floor Division → 3
print(a % b)  # Modulus (Remainder) → 1
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation → 1000
```

### 2. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values:

#### Example:
```python
x = 10
x += 5  # x = x + 5 → 15
x *= 2  # x = x * 2 → 30
print(x)
```

### 3. Comparison Operators
Used for value comparison (returns True/False):

#### Example:
```python
a, b = 10, 3
print(a > b)   # True
print(a < b)   # False
print(a == b)  # False
print(a != b)  # True
```

### 4. Logical Operators
Used for multiple conditions:

#### Example:
```python
score = 75
attendance = 85

if score > 50 and attendance > 75:
    print("Pass with good attendance")  # Output: Pass with good attendance
```

## Best Practices:

- Use **f-strings** for clean formatting in print statements.
- Use **comparison and logical operators** for making decisions in programs.
- Use **proper indentation** for if-else conditions to avoid errors.
