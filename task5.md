# Task_5: Other Data Types - Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

## Objective:

### Lists: Ordered, Mutable Collection
A **list** is an ordered collection of items, and it is **mutable**, meaning you can change its content after creation.
Lists are defined using **square brackets `[]`**, and items are separated by **commas `,`**.

#### Example of a list:
```python
learning_topics = ["Variables", "Data Types", "Control Flow", "Functions", "Loops"]
```

### Tuples: Ordered, Immutable Collection
A **tuple** is similar to a list, but unlike lists, **tuples are immutable**, meaning you **cannot modify** the items once the tuple is created.
Tuples are defined using **parentheses `()`**.

#### Example of a tuple:
```python
project_elements = ("feedback", "progress", "status")
```

### Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs
A **dictionary** is an unordered collection of items, where each item is stored as a pair consisting of a **key** and a **value**.
Dictionaries are defined using **curly braces `{}`**, and the key-value pairs are separated by a **colon `:`**.

#### Example of a dictionary:
```python
project_status = {"topic": "Variables", "status": "Not Started"}
```

## Practice:

1. A **list** of learning topics.
2. A **tuple** that holds elements of a mini-project.
3. A **dictionary** to represent the status of a mini-project element.

## Best Practices:

- **Lists**: Use lists when you need to store an ordered collection of items that you might need to **modify** (add/remove elements).
- **Tuples**: Use tuples when you need an ordered collection of items that should **remain constant** (e.g., coordinates, fixed data).
- **Dictionaries**: Use dictionaries for storing **key-value pairs**, especially when you need to **map** a specific piece of data (like the status of a task or project).
