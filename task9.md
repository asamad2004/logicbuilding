# Task_9

## While Loop in Python

### Objective:
A while loop runs as long as a specified condition remains True.

### Example:
```python
while condition:
    # Code that runs in loop
```
## Best Practices:

- Ensure loops have an exit condition to prevent infinite loops.
- Use `.lower()` to make input case-insensitive.
- Use `break` to stop the loop when needed.
